## Branding

Vitamin Bee's branding was designed to be welcoming and reflective of the products and experiences being sold. The client should be able to navigate the site easily, finding the products they want, but also able to learn more about the health benefits of using these products. The design is pleasant and warm, with a limited colour palette so as to not distract or complicate the process of getting information, or finding the items desired for purchase.

Information is presented in a clean and organized manner, with a soft and warm colour palette that keeps on theme. The visuals are a mixture of photographs and illustrated elements, which are meant to establish a whimsical lens through which to learn about and purchase honey.

### Logo

The Vitamin Bee logo is simple, meant to clearly depict the product being sold but to also incorporate the whimsical design style that is throughout the site, as well as the familiar two fonts seen throughout. This hand-drawn bee was a large inspiration for the rest of the website design incorporating this prominent style.

### Colours

The site uses a warm scheme that implies the colour of honey, as well as bees. The natural, earthy browns also compliment the theme of healthy, holistic products.

### Typography

Masquarelo is meant to invoke a sense of whimsy to the design, while Cronos provides a solid sans-serif in which to do buttons and basic product descriptions, so the design is clean and functional.
